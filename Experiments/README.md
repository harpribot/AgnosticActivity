## Experiments
Each folder contains one or more Experiments. Details of each experiment can be found in the respective directories.

## Test suite
run `bash eval_all_models.sh` to generate .pkl files for all the models on all the datasets.

@Harshal, could you add calls to your testing scripts for the caffe models here and have them save .pkl files to `Prediction_Pickles` ?
