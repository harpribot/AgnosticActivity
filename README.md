# AgnosticActivity

The project involves separating the object recognition task from activity recognition, so that, the activity recognition is agnostic to the objects that are involves, and thus improves learning when the dataset is heavily skewed towards certain objects performing certain activities, which wont lead to better generalization if different objects are performing the same activity.
